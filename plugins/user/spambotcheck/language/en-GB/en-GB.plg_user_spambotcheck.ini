COM_PLUGINS_COMPONENT_OPTIONS_FIELDSET_LABEL="Advanced - Component Options"

PLG_USER_SPAMBOTCHECK_COMPONENT_OPTIONS_DESC="<div style='font-size: 13px;'>User Plugin Spambotcheck may not be able to block every spam user who tries to register or login on your website. This may have different reasons. One of which is that sometimes spammers find a security hole and there is a sudden boost of spambot attempts with a new quality. It may take the online spambot databases some days to adjust to the new conditions and during that time you may find a significant increase of spam users who were able to register on your website.<br /><br />Therefore User Plugin Spambotcheck collects further information about users on registration and stores this information in the database, extending the Joomla! users table. Furthermore the plugin tries to spot users with suspicious behaviour and flag those users in the database. <br /><br />With the Joomla! <b>component</b> Spambotcheck, which is automatically installed with this plugin (see Component Manager), you can check on this valuable information and manage possible spam users much easier. Take a look at it.<br /><br />One suspicious behavior is, when during a 'short' timespan 'many' different users with the same IP try to register. The plugin will flag all those users as suspicious. You can set two parameters to controll this process. The maximum timespam between the first and the actual registration in which multi registration with the same IP is suspicious (which defines what is 'short'). And the number of successful registrations during that timespam, which makes the IP supsicious (which defines what is 'many').</div>"

In order to make the check, the IP address, the email address and the username of the user (depending on the settings, which you make in the plugin configuration) is used in a request to the online spambot data bases which are enabled in the plugin configuration settings.
