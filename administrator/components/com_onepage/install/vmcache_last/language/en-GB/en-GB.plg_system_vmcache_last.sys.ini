This plugin is triggered ONLY when there are no items in the cart, user is not logged in and there are no messages in the queue. Please report issues to info@rupostel.com. This plugin IS NOT compatible with all of the extensions available for Joomla and the site visitor may be shown cached results on pages where it should not be shown.
