If you do see the shipping plugin working under a normal Virtuemart checkout, but it does not work under OPC please make sure it is available to both <strong>-default- and -anonymous- shopper group</strong>.

If you decide to shorten customfied_value to indexable size (ideally 160 utf8 or utf8mb4 characters) you can also use index on customfield_value which can speed up your custom filters (breakdesign custom field filters) by 20x to 40x. <b>IMPORTANT: CREATE BACKUP OF #__virtuemart_product_customfields BEFORE USING ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS HERE!</b> "
